Hey there. This is a project I'm working on that solves Sudoku puzzles.

I am just starting the project now, so don't expect anything to be functional.

I'm sure that many other people have created similar projects and that algorithms exist that would make this much simpler, but for the fun of it I plan to formulate all of the algorithms myself.

You can view the current version of the project at aj-michael.github.io/SudokuSolver
