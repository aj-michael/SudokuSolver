UPDATE: I believe the solver is now in a working state. It will warn you (with background colors) if you attempt to enter a clearly unsolvable puzzle, but if you attempt to solve it anyways it will crash your browser. If the puzzle has multiple solutions, only one will be displayed.

Hey there. This is a project I'm working on that solves Sudoku puzzles.

I am just starting the project now, so don't expect anything to be functional.

I'm sure that many other people have created similar projects and that algorithms exist that would make this much simpler, but for the fun of it I plan to formulate all of the algorithms myself.

You can view the current version of the project at aj-michael.github.io/SudokuSolver
